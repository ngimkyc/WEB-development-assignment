           <h2> Site Report</h2>

           <p>
              This site report explains my experience of learning the basics of web
              development during this module. Creating this website was a new and 
              interesting experience for me,as i had never build a website before.
              Throughout the module, I gained practical skills and confidence in using
              web technologies.The process helped me understand how websites are planned,
              designed, and developed step by step.
           </p>
          

           <p>
              At the start of the module, I had very little knowledge of web development.
              Learnings HTML helped me understand how to structure web pages using
              headings, paragraphs, links, and navigation menus.
           </p>

           <p>
              Learning CSS was more challenging but also very rewarding. I learned how 
              to style web pages using colours,fonts,spacing, and layouts to improve 
              appereance and usability.Debugging CSS issues taught me patience and 
              problem-solving skills, as small errors could affect the entire layout.
              Over time,I became more confident in testing and refining my code.
           </p>

           <p>
              For the design of my website, I chose a simple and clean layout with a
              consistent navigation bar across all pages. I used blue accent colours
              to create a modern look and improve usability.
           </p>

           <p> 
             During the development process, I also used AI-based tools in some places
             to help me understand errors,improve code structure,and clarify concepts. 
             This support helped me learn more effectively while ensuring that I 
             understood and implemented the solutions myself.

           <h3>Video Demo of My Website</h3>
           <p>
              Below is a video demonstration of the website I created during this module
              You can watch how the pages are navigated and see the layout in action.
